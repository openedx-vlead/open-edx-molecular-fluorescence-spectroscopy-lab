  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p>

This lab is about molecular fluorescence spectroscopy. In molecular fluorescence spectroscopy, a molecule is first irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) or visible radiation and then the emission of light of longer wavelengths is detected. Many common materials like certain minerals, human teeth, riboflavin (vitamin B2), etc. fluoresce, emitting visible light after absorbing ultraviolet light. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a technique of considerable practical importance. Measurements of fluorescence can provide important information regarding the molecule, its quantity and local environment, etc. Fluorescence spectroscopy finds widespread use in basic and applied researches of chemical and biological sciences fields of sensing, environmental monitoring, DNA sequencing, cell identification and sorting in flow cytometry, and so on. Analytical techniques based on fluorescence can yield low detection limits and are very sensitive (approach that of electrochemical methods), highly specific, often economical and relatively simple to perform. The high specificity arises from the fact that fluorophores exhibit specific excitation (absorption) and emission (fluorescence) wavelengths. In crime investigation, fingerprints can be revealed by their yellow fluorescence, when argon-ion lasers are used to flood an area with intense blue light. </p>
