<p>Pre-experiment Quiz</p>
<ol>
<li>How can you explain the existence of a fluorescence quantum yield?</li>
<li>The quantum yield of a fluorophore is 0.9. What will be the percentage of molecules in an excited electronic state that decay to ground state by fluorescence emission?</li>
<li>Why is the quantum yield of a fluorophore less than or equal to unity?</li>
<li>What is the quantum yield of a non-fluorescent compound?</li>
<li>Why does an increase in temperature decrease the fluorescence quantum yield? (Hint: Increase in the Brownian motions)</li>
</ol>
<p>Post-experiment Quiz</p>
<ol>
<li>How are the solutions for the measurements prepared from the stock solutions so that both the solutions will have the same 0.032 absorbance value?</li>
<li>Which fluorophore will you choose &ndash; a high or low quantum yield one &ndash; in order to produce a higher relative emission intensity?</li>
<li>Which of the two fluorophores studied here undergoes more non-radiative transitions?</li>
<li>Why is it recommended to have low concentrations of fluorophore solution such that the absorbance value of the fluorophore is less than 0.05 at the excitation wavelength?</li>
<li>Mention a few common sources of errors in the relative quantum yield determination.</li>
