<h3>Singlet-Triplet States</h3>
<p>In an electronic transition, the electronic configuration changes, i.e., one or more electron(s) in the molecule are rearranged in available higher energy orbitals. Depending on the spin orientations of the excited electron in the new orbital, the states are designated as singlet (S) or triplet (T). In the following we discuss about the singlet and triplet electronic states.</p>
<p>In polyatomic molecules, it is convenient to classify the electronic transitions by specifying the initial and final orbitals. For example, if an electronic transition occurs from a bonding pi (&pi;) orbital to an antibonding pi orbital (&pi;<sup>&lowast;</sup>), we call it a &pi; &rarr; &pi;<sup>&lowast;</sup> transition and similarly for a transition from a nonbonding orbital (n) to an antibonding pi orbital (&pi;<sup>&lowast; </sup>) is known as n &rarr; &pi;<sup>&lowast;</sup> transition. Carbonyl group (&gt;C=O) is one of the examples that has both the nonbonding (n) and pi electrons. In the ground state of C=O group, two sigma bonding electrons, two pi bonding electrons, and four nonbonding electrons are all spin-paired (their spins are in opposite directions). Because there is not any un(-spin)-paired electron, the ground state has a singlet (S) multiplicity (Multiplicity = number of un(-spin)-paired electrons + 1). The name 'singlet' originated from the fact that the spin-paired state (&uarr;&darr;) of the singlet state can adopt only 'one' orientation with respect to an external magnetic field. Molecules in their normal or ground states have all the electrons spin-paired (exception: oxygen). Therefore all molecules in their ground states are in singlet (S) state (exception: oxygen in triplet state). If energy is supplied, one of these spin-paired electrons (say, from n or &pi; orbital) is excited to a higher energy orbital (say, &pi;<sup>&lowast;</sup>). Now what will be the spin state of the excited electron in this new orbital? One can think of the following two situations. Firstly, the excited electron may have the same spin orientation as it had in its originating (n or &pi;) orbital (i.e., the spin is reserved). In this case, the electrons are still spin-paired (though in different energy orbitals). Since the electrons are spin-paired, the spin multiplicity of the state is one i.e., a &lsquo;singlet&rsquo; state (S). This singlet state has higher energy than the ground singlet state. Secondly, the spin of the excited electron may flip under suitable circumstances (it undergoes intersystem crossing: singlet to triplet). In this case, the two electrons (one in the originating n or &pi; orbital and the other in the new excited orbital) have the same spin orientation. Therefore the two electrons are no longer spin-paired (having parallel spin orientations). Because there are two un(-spin)-paired electrons, the multiplicity =2+1=3, a &lsquo;triplet&rsquo;. There are nonbonding as well as pi electrons available to be excited. Therefore, for these transitions there are more than one excited singlets and triplets states of different energies present. We designate the manifold of singlet states as S<sub>0</sub> (ground state), S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>,&hellip;.. and the manifold of triplets as T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>,&hellip;. in order of increasing energy. Because triplets are generally formed by electronic excitation, the lowest energy triplet state is labeled as the first excited triplet, T<sub>1</sub>, state as opposed to T<sub>0</sub>. We should remember that manifold of vibrational states exists for each of these electronic states and similarly manifold of rotational states will exist for each vibrational level.</p>
<p>Upon light absorption, electronic transitions result from the interaction between electrons and the electric field component of the light. The magnetic contribution to the absorption is negligible compared to the electric contribution because of the speed of electron rotation on itself is very weak compared to the light velocity [Total energy, F = (eE) + (evH /c) , where e, c, v, E, and H are, respectively, the electron charge, light velocity, speed of rotation of the electron on itself, and electric and magnetic components of the light wave]. Thus, a displaced electron preserves the same spin orientation during absorption excitation. Therefore, if the ground state of a molecule is a singlet state then the transition of the electron occurs to an excited singlet state. In other words, singlet to triplet transitions are forbidden, unless it is assisted by some other mechanism (such as spin-orbit couplings). Similarly, the electronic transition from T &rarr; S is formally forbidden (from the selection rules point of view). The absorption of light can excite the molecules from lowest energy singlet state S<sub>0</sub> to higher energy singlet state S<sub>1</sub> and even to S<sub>2</sub> if the excitation energy is sufficient.</p>
<h3>Fluorescence and Phosphorescence</h3>
<p>The Franck-Condon principle states that the heavier nuclei do not change their positions during the fast electronic excitation. This results in an initial geometry of the excited state which is usually not the energy minimum geometry. According to the Franck&ndash;Condon principle, the molecule will most probably be excited to one of the higher vibrational states of the excited electronic state. The molecule in an excited vibrational energy level loses energy rapidly (in 10<sup>&ndash;12</sup> s or less) and moves to a lower (and finally to the lowest) vibrational energy level in the same excited electronic state. Once the molecule is in the lowest vibrational level of the excited electronic state, S<sub>1</sub>, the molecule can return to one of the vibrational states of the ground singlet state, S<sub>0</sub> through an emission of photon radiation, called fluorescence, or via other relaxation path ways. In fluorescence, the acquired (absorbed) electronic energy is lost via the emission of a photon while transition occurs from lowest vibrational level of first excited singlet (i.e., v=0 of S<sub>1</sub>) to one of the vibrational states of the ground singlet state, S<sub>0</sub>. This radiative process takes about 10<sup>-9</sup> second. Most compounds decay by non-radiative processes (such as heat) and are therefore not fluorescent.</p>
<p>If by some mechanisms, intersystem crossing (say, spin forbidden transition S<sub>1</sub> &rarr; T<sub>1</sub>) occurs, then a radiative transition T<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>0</sub>, called phosphorescence, may occur. In intersystem crossing, a molecule in the ground vibrational energy level of an excited electronic state passes into a high vibrational energy level of a lower energy electronic state with a different spin state (say, S<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>1</sub>). Iintersystem crossing requires a mechanism for converting the paired electron spins (&uarr;&darr;) of the singlet state to unpaired electron spins (&uarr;&uarr;) of the triplet state. Spin&ndash;orbit coupling and vibronic coupling favor intersystem crossing. In spin-orbit coupling, the magnetic field arising from an electron's orbital motion around the nucleus interacts with the spin magnetic moment of the electron which helps in spin reversal or flipping of electron orientation (from &uarr;&darr; to &uarr;&uarr;). The strength of the orbitally generated magnetic field increases as the nuclear charge increases. The efficiency of this coupling varies with the fourth power of the atomic number. After intersystem crossing, the molecule as usual undergoes vibrational relaxation and moves down the vibrational energy levels of the T<sub>1</sub> state by loss of energy in collisions with surrounding molecules. Then the molecule may transit from T<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>0</sub> by the emission of a photon, called phosphorescence. The forbidden transition of the molecule from T<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>0</sub> to occur requires a similar mechanism that permitted singlet to triplet intersystem crossing. Typical mean time for phosphorescence (1 millisecond to 10 second) is longer than that for fluorescence.</p>
