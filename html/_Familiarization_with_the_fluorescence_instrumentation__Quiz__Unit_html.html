<h3>Pre-experiment Quiz</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Why do we need a radiation source of high optical power (that is, a large number of photons per unit time) in spectrofluorimeter?</li>
<li>Why do we use xenon arc lamp as source in spectrofluorimeter?</li>
<li>Why is a detector more powerful preferred in spectrofluorimeter than that in spectrophotometer?</li>
<li>Fluorescence spectra can be presented on either a wavelength scale or a wavenumber scale. Which scale is linear in energy?</li>
<li>What are the advantages and the disadvantages of using a laser instead of a lamp as an excitation source?</li>
<li>All emission measurements must start far enough above the excitation wavelength. Why? (Hint. Near the excitation wavelength, reflectance, refraction and scattering are high.)</li>

<h3>Post-experiment Quiz</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>A quartz cuvette with all sides transparent are used in spectrofluorimetric measurements, unlike the ones for UV-visible spectrophotometric measurements where two opposite sides are transparent. Why?</li>
<li>Why is the front face or right angle collection geometry used in fluorescence spectroscopy instead of 180&deg; collection geometry that is used in UV-visible absorption spectroscopy?</li>
<li>What collection geometry was used in the present experiment?</li>
<li>What happens to the emission spectrum when the chosen excitation wavelength lies far away from the actual maximum excitation wavelength?</li>
<li>&ldquo;One has to be sure that the solvent blank does not fluoresce in the wavelength range of interest.&rdquo; Why?</li>
