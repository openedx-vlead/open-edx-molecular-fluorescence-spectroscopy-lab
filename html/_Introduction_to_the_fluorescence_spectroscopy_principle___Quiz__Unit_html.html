<li>How many possible orientations can two parallel spins adopt with respect to the external magnetic field? Show by schematic diagram.</li>
<li>What are the spin multiplicity and the spin of triplet state?</li>
<li>Why two electrons are always present in two different orbitals of the molecule in triplet state?</li>
<li>Internal conversion (takes place at a time scale of 10<sup>-12</sup> s) is faster than the fluorescence emission. Then how does radiative emission (fluorescence) compete with the non-radiative transition? (Hint: Significantly larger energy gap between S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>0</sub> and longer lifetime of S<sub>1</sub>.)</li>
<li>Transitions between states of different multiplicity are formally forbidden. What are the mechanisms that make the intersystem crossing probable?</li>
<li>How can you justify that the relaxation to ground state occurs via &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; transition?</li>
<li>In most of the cases, the S<sub>1</sub> potential energy curve shifts to the right with respect to S<sub>0</sub> potential energy curve. Justify it. (Hint: In the excited state, the electron is promoted to an anti-bonding orbital.</li>
<li>Why are absorption and fluorescence much faster than phosphorescence?</li>
